# Accessibility

## Learning objectives
- Describe core principles of building accessible websites and explain why accessibility is important.

### Estimated time: 1.5h

## Description 
Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.
More specifically, people can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web.
Web accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for everyone in a variety of situations (e.g. people using a slow internet connection, older people with changing abilities due to ageing).

### Why is it important?

When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them.
However, currently many sites and tools are developed with accessibility barriers that make them difficult or impossible for some people to use.
Making the web accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society.

### How to make your website accessible

- Make sure that you understand what accessibility means by reading this [introduction to web accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/).
- Learn which elements on your website can make your project more accessible by reading [Easy Checks â€“ A First Review of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/). You will use this resource to evaluate your project soon!
