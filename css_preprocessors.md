# CSS preprocessors

## Learning objectives

- Understand the usefulness of CSS preprocessors.

### Estimated time: 2h

## Description

CSS preprocessors are tools that allow you to write CSS in a more modern and powerful syntax. They include features like variables, nesting, partials or mixings. The workflow to use them has 2 steps:
1. Write your styles with a new syntax (e.g., SCSS or LESS).
2. Then "transpile" the preprocessor code into CSS code so it can be interpreted by your browser.

### Why are CSS preprocessors important?

The code that you create with CSS preprocessors is usually better and easier to maintain than plain CSS. In general CSS preprocessor code helps developers prevent repetition, provides better structure, and decouples functionality. Therefore, they are widely used in the industry, and important tools like Rails, Bootstrap and React are designed so that developers can use CSS preprocessors without any extra configuration.
