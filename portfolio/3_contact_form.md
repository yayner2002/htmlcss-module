# Portfolio: add a contact form and finish the mobile version

## Learning objectives

- Create forms with HTML5 validations.
- Understand the importance of UX.
- Understand how to parse a Figma design to create a UI.

### Estimated time: 4.5h

## Description

For the third milestone of your portfolio website, you will:

- Add a contact form to your portfolio and the portfolio of your coding partner.
- Make sure that you guide your users' experience in a way that helps them fill in the form without frustration.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct [GitHub flow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### HTML/CSS requirements

- Follow our list of [best practices for HTML & CSS](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/html_css_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements

_**IMPORTANT NOTE:** For each Microverse project, you need to create a separate pull request. [Read how to work with multiple pull requests in your one repository in the most efficient way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/multiple_pull_requests.md)._

- The section you need to build for this milestone is: 
    - the contact form:
    <p align="center">
     <img src="./images/m3_contact_form/contact_form_v3.png" alt="Form" />
    </p>
    - and the footer (if present in the design)
We included a screenshot of Template 1 for reference, but you should follow the template that you chose.
- Make sure that:
    - Name field accepts up to 30 chars.
    - Email field accepts only emails.
    - Message field accepts up to 500 chars.
    - All fields have placeholder text.
    - All fields have the correct type.
    - A user cannot submit the form if one or more of the fields is empty.
- Collect data by using the [Formspree service](https://formspree.io/html).
- In order to lay out the elements on the page you should use Flexbox.
- You don't need to implement any functionality that requires JavaScript.
- You must stick to the design as much as possible (e.g., font, colors, images, text, margins) using [the templates in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=0%3A1).
- Implement the button interactions (enable, hover, etc.).


### Need a big picture?

Remind me about [the big picture of this project](./sneak_peek.md).

## Work and submission mode

- You should implement the above requirements in **all repositories** in your pair-programming group. _That means that each group member needs to open a new pull request in their repo._
- We will check the commit history to make sure that everybody has contributed code on each project.
- You should ask for a review and submit this activity **individually.**

## Code review

Follow [these steps](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/articles/how_to_ask_for_a_code_review.md) to request a code review of your project.

## Submit your project

After the final approval from a code reviewer, you need to submit your project.
[Read this FAQ for a reminder on how to submit your project.](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061344234)
Now go to your Student Dashboard and submit your project.
