# Portfolio: accessibility

## Learning objectives
- Describe core principles of building accessible websites and explain why accessibility is important.

### Estimated time: 3h

## Description

In the sixth milestone of your portfolio website, you will:

- evaluate your website against accessibility best practices and implement any necessary changes to ensure that your website is accessible.


*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project and remember to **reach out to Student Success right away if you are experiencing difficulties with your partner.** If you reach out early in the week, we are more likely to help you by understanding what is happening, speaking to your partner if needed or in some cases, re-pairing you.*

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct [GitHub flow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### HTML/CSS requirements

- Follow our list of [best practices for HTML & CSS](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/html_css_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements


_**IMPORTANT NOTE:** For each Microverse project, you need to create a separate pull request. [Read how to work with multiple pull requests in your one repository in the most efficient way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/multiple_pull_requests.md)._

- Check all of the items listed in the article [Easy Checks â€“ A First Review of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/) (which you already read in the previous lesson).
- Determine if your Portfolio needs any changes.
- Make changes in a separate branch and open a new pull request.
- Prepare a report listing all points that you have checked, and the result of your evaluation.
- Your report should include:
     -  List all points that you have checked, i.e:
        - [Page titles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/#title)
        - [Image text alternatives** (`<img alt="alt text">`)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/#images)
        - [Text headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/#headings)
        - [Color contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/#contrast)
        - [Resize](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/#resize)
        - [Interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/#interaction) 
          (labels are optional but recommended as voiceover tools can read them, and should be set as invisible to match the Figma design)
        - [Moving content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/#moving)
        - [Multimedia](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/#media)
        - [The basic structure of the page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/#structure)
     - Each point on the list needs to include the result of your evaluation:
        - If everything was ok, make a statement about that (e.g. "Page titles - no issues found").
        - If you needed to change something, [link to the corresponding line of code in your pull request changes](http://www.chasewoodford.com/blog/linking-highlighted-lines-code-github/#:~:text=To%20link%20to%20multiple%20lines,php%23L117%2DL148).
- Add your report to the description of your pull request.
