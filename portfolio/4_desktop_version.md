# Portfolio: desktop version

## Learning objectives
- Understand  how to create UIs adaptable to different screen sizes using media queries.
- Understand how to parse a Figma design to create a UI.

### Estimated time: 8.5h

## Description

For the fourth project in your portfolio website, you will:

- Use media queries to make sure that your website displays correctly on desktop screens.


**You have time for this project scheduled in to 2 days. Please ask for a code review when you are ready.**

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct ([Github flow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### HTML/CSS requirements

- Follow our list of [best practices for HTML & CSS](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/html_css_best_practices.md).

### Project requirements


_**IMPORTANT NOTE:** For each Microverse project, you need to create a separate pull request. [Read how to work with multiple pull requests in your one repository in the most efficient way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/multiple_pull_requests.md)._

- You need to make sure that your dekstop version looks like the one in the Figma design template that you chose. We include a screenshot of Template 1 below for reference, but you should use the template that you chose.
- **IMPORTANT NOTE** some Figma design templates include two input fields (for first name and last name) in the desktop version and one input field (for full name) in the mobile version (look for those cases in *Contact me* or *Get in touch* sections). **Please ignore this part of the design template and use only one input for the full name for all versions.**

    </p>

- Use media queries in your CSS file to make your desktop version look like the template you selected (Desktop: >=768px).
- In order to lay out the elements on the page you should use Grid and Flexbox.
- You don't need to implement any functionality that requires JavaScript.
- You must replicate the design as much as possible (e.g., font, colors, images, text, margins) using [the info from the Figma templates](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=0%3A1).
