# Sneak peek: your portfolio

## Learning objectives

- Understand how to parse a Figma design to create a UI.
- Build a personal portfolio site.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

Your portfolio website is one of the most powerful tools in your software developer toolbox; it’s the easiest way of showing what you’re truly capable of as a developer, and is a **quick and simple way for recruiters and hiring managers to get an idea of what you can bring to their teams**.

As you work your way through Microverse curriculum materials you will complete several small projects that will combine to create a website for your portfolio. A portfolio website is a key job searching tool for a web developer, and we want you to start working on it from the beginning of the Microverse program. 

In this project, you will **precisely replicate one of the portfolio templates** we are providing for you. However, later on during your Microverse journey you will customize and improve it to make it more unique, as well as include more of your own projects in the portfolio.

### What makes a good portfolio website?

In essence, if you look at any of the example portfolios templates we list below, you’ll see that they each contain four shared traits:

- They are all **simple**: there’s no extraneous information, only basic background information, contact information, and a project showcase.
- They are all **visual**: they use screenshots, mockups, live demos, and other visual tools to show the viewer what you’re capable of making.
- They are all **thorough**: while the design itself may be simple, they make use of links (both in-text and otherwise) to show extra background information about their work, projects, and history.
- And they all **look good**: they use 1-3 elegant fonts, focus on 2-3 different colors, use HD images, and use color palettes that look good together.

### Portfolio templates & how to use Figma

We have provided some solid portfolio templates you can choose from. Choose the one you like the most. The templates are hosted on Figma - a collaborative UI design tool built in the browser. Please watch [this video](https://www.loom.com/embed/167236d17f104fc18298c5c9888354c9) to learn how to navigate the templates on Figma.

If you still have questions about how to use Figma you can visit and interact with [the Figma community](https://forum.figma.com/).

Here you will find [the Microverse student portfolio templates](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=0%3A1).

**You should select one template for your personal portfolio in order to proceed with the next steps.**

### Mobile first approach

Your portfolio should be prepared for different screen sizes (be responsive). You will learn more about it in the following week. However, you should be aware that in the set of following projects you will build your portfolio by using a **"mobile first" approach**.

- [What is Mobile First CSS and Why Does It Rock?](https://www.mightyminnow.com/2013/11/what-is-mobile-first-css-and-why-does-it-rock/). 
- [What is the difference between fixed, fluid, adaptive and responsive layouts and why should I care?](https://ux-alpaca.medium.com/so-what-exactly-is-the-difference-between-fixed-fluid-adaptive-and-responsive-layouts-and-why-3773272d8481)
- [Responsive web design (RWD) with media queries](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/9994802d0d47e69b3dee918d3f32175fdead7ea3/responsivness.md)

Please, keep in mind that **the first version of your website will need to be refactored** once we ask you to build also the Desktop version.

### Projects list

You will be building your **portfolio website** during the first module of the program. Here is the list of projects that will guide you. You will find details about each of the projects requirements in the upcoming program activities. 

In some of the projects you will be working individually, but in others you will be working collaboratively with your coding partner.

- Project 1: Setup and mobile version skeleton
- Project 2: Mobile version
- Project 3: Contact form (pair programming)
- Project 4: Desktop version
- Project 5: Application deploy
- Project 6: Evaluate accessibility (pair programming)
