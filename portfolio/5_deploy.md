# Portfolio: application deploy

## Learning objectives
- Use GitHub Pages to deploy web pages.
- Demonstrate ability to ask clarifying questions about ambiguous requirements.

### Estimated time: 1.5h

## Description
For this milestone you will make your website available online.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### General requirements

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that you used correct flow ([Github Flow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### Project requirements


_**IMPORTANT NOTE:** For each Microverse project, you need to create a separate pull request. [Read how to work with multiple pull requests in your one repository in the most efficient way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/multiple_pull_requests.md)._

- Deploy your website using GitHub Pages.
- Check the online version of your portfolio and make sure that the page works properly.
- Update the README of your repository to include a link to the online version.
- _If by any chance you have deployed your app earlier, open an issue with a link to the online version of your app. Otherwise, submit a link to the PR with changes required for the deploy._
