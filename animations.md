# Animations and transitions

## Learning objectives

- Understand the usefulness of transitions and animations.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

We have the possibility of adding transitions and animations to our website to make it more appealing for visitors and provide them a better user experience.

With *transitions* we can make elements on the page change smoothly while the user is interacting with them. For example, when the user moves the mouse over an element we can change the font color gradually or make an image grow slightly.

*Animations* do not require an user interaction to start moving. With animations you can make changes to an element's properties and repeat those changes continuously.

### Why are animations and transitions important?

A nice use of animations and transitions can make your webapp feel:
- easier to understand.
- smoother, more natural, and of higher quality.
- more engaging.
