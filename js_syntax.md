# Basic JavaScript syntax recap

## Learning objectives

- Use basic JavaScript syntax.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

You already know JavaScript as you proved in the Admissions Trials. But it is worth a recap on the syntax of the language, mostly about how to manipulate data structures (arrays and objects). We will also look at JavaScript best practices.

### Why is refreshing your JavaScript knowledge important?

You will be using a lot of JavaScript in the next several lessons and projects, so it is important that you refresh your basic JavaScript knowledge in order to write JavaScript that follows the best practices.

### Why are JavaScript best practices important?

If you follow best practices, working with your code will be easier - for you and for other developers.

### Learn more

Learn about the [JavaScript best practices](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md) that you will need to adhere to in all of your Microverse projects.
