# The DOM and events

## Learning objectives

- Use JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements.
- Use JavaScript events.
- Show a basic understanding of how the DOM works.

### Estimated time: 1.5h

## Description

As you may know, we can use JavaScript to make changes in a webpage. When JavaScript is used as a client-side programming language it is executed in the user's browser. The interface (API) to access the HTML elements from JavaScript is called the DOM (Document Object Model). Using the DOM you can access the HTML elements of your website and manipulate them.

Also, the DOM allows you to be aware of how the user is interacting with your website, and allows you to execute some actions when the user "triggers an event." For example, when the user clicks a button you can execute JavaScript code to show a success message.

### Why is the DOM important?

As a web developer, it is important for you to be able to create interactive websites that are not just plain content. You should be able to use JavaScript to make changes in the page based on user interactions with the content.
