# CSS frameworks

## Learning objectives

- Understand the concept of CSS frameworks.
- Use documentation for CSS frameworks.

### Estimated time: 2h

## Description

CSS frameworks are a set of CSS and JS resources that speed up the process of building a new website. They provide a set of elements that are needed to build a new modern front-end project: a grid system, breakpoints, and pre-built components.

### Why are CSS frameworks important?

Building a new website from scratch with a CSS framework is super fast. This makes them a good fit for several business use cases. The main one is creating MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) that need to be developed quickly to test some business hypothesis. Also, a CSS framework could be used to build more long-term projects since the pre-built components that the framework offers can be personalized.
