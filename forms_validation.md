### Estimated time: 2h

## Forms
If you have ever used the internet (and you have! ;)) you should know what a form looks like.
Anytime you need to share your name, telephone number, or even just share your thoughts via the internet, most likely you are using an HTML form.

### Why is it important?

The main purpose of a form is to collect user input and send it to the server where it can be processed and/or stored. Without that, the user would not be able to interact with the server.

### How to build a good form?

To collect data from your users:
- Learn [how to build a form in HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Your_first_form).
- Determine [which kind of inputs you can use](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-forms/).
- Check [how to validate user input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation#using_built-in_form_validation).

## User Experience (UX)

If you use correct input types and set up validations, the users of your website will have a smooth and straightforward experience. The core of UX is being conscious of the experience of your users during the design process of your entire website. UX focuses on having a deep understanding of users, what they need, what they value, their abilities, and also their limitations.

### Why is it important?

Websites are tools that are being used by people. They should work in a way that feels natural for people and saves them from frustration.
Therefore, the better UX you provide, the bigger value you provide to your users. 

### Guiding questions

As you learn about UX, here are some questions to consider to put yourself in the mindset of one of your users:
- Think of some websites that you really enjoy using. What features make them enjoyable to use?
- Think of some websites that make you frustrated when you have to use them. What features make them difficult for you to use?
- What website features frustrate you when you fill out online forms? What website features make filling out online forms easier for you?
- Do you notice when developers make subtle changes on forms, like pre-filling fields with sample content and changing the keyboard type for numerical input on mobile devices?
A lot of what makes UX on a website feel easy to use or difficult to use has to do with how information is delivered to the user, and how easy it is for the user to input information.

### UX for web developers

UX designer is a separate profession from web developer - that already tells a lot about how huge this topic is. As a short intro please read:
