# Test your knowledge: Microverse program requirements


## Learning objectives

- Identify your mastery of the knowledge and skills required to participate successfully in the Microverse Full-stack program. 

### Estimated time: 0.75h


## Description

In this activity, you will test your mastery of basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub & Git, and pair programming. 


### Why is this important?

The Full-stack curriculum of Microverse is based on the assumption that students master basic knowledge and skills related to web technologies, **upon their enrollment**. Thus, the learning activities and resources included in the program will not cover these topics in depth. Since the program is very intensive, we recommend that you identify now any knowledge gaps that you might have and review the necessary content as soon as possible.

### Will my scores be considered for my academic progress?

No. You must complete this activity and submit the quiz, but you are not required to obtain a minimum number of correct answers. The purpose of the quiz is to help you self-assess your mastery of the program requirements so that you can self-regulate your learning. Being aware of what you know and what you don't know  is essential to your professional development.   


## Instructions

1. Please complete [this quiz](https://forms.gle/HuwHTTJTRvDjEHcQ7).

2. After you submit your responses, you will be able to see the questions that you missed and identify the topics that you need to review. Make a plan to study these topics; you can use the Level Up content that we recommend or look for information online. 
 
3. Once you are ready, mark this activity as completed in your Students Dashboard.
